# Control Capabilities

The existing github does not have this. We could:
- Informally document testing successes and failures 
- Have a complete list of locomotive capabilities (ie. walking speeds/patterns, flipping over, standing up, balancing, etc) that we have accomplished
- Links to our report and YouTube videos for more descriptive explanations
