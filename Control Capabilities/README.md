# Control Capabilities
[Return to the main Table of Contents](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Formatting#table-of-contents)

The existing github does not have this. We could:
- Informally document testing successes and failures 
- Have a complete list of locomotive capabilities (ie. walking speeds/patterns, flipping over, standing up, balancing, etc) that we have accomplished
- Links to our report and YouTube videos for more descriptive explanations


Based on the research paper, we expect to:
- Measure the range of stiffness 
- Push on leg → deflection, measure ground reaction force and leg length using a force plate and string potentiometer. Compute the effective leg stiffness using linear regression
- Drop the leg → shows impedance capabilities of contact force (oscillations)
- Jumping experiments 
- Demonstrate dynamic behavior
- Write an algorithm that locally optimizes trajectories based on the full robot dynamics 
- Stand after a turn-over. Bend knee joints into ‘X’, ‘O’, ‘C’ 
- Balancing on platforms. Slow and fast walks. Robust to uncertain environments. 65 cm vertical jump, landing without damage. 

Ideas for future capabilities:
- Stabilizing/balance control (ie. push it, it stabilizes itself)
- Test how much weight it can carry and walk with
- Implement different walking patterns
- Experiment with inclined slopes/torques
