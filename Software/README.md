The existing github page published a few [code demos](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/solo/tree/master/demos) (only for their solo robot and mainly for calibration). The research paper links to a [repository](https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/documentation_portal/#readme) of open source code.
We need to verify if we can publish our code open source.
If not, we could document our procedure to code the robot.
