# Revisions
[Return to the main Table of Contents](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Formatting#table-of-contents)

The existing github does not have this. We could:
- Link to the other githubâ€™s online Forum
- Write suggestions based on our ongoing revision notes for design improvements.

## Communications
We should look into switching between an ethernet tethered connection and a receiver/transmitter (ie. if we wanted to go fully untethered with the battery power supply option)


## Battery Supply Organization
There are no specific mounting slots for the batteries or push buttons or the power management board(s) on the existing CAD. We'd look into making these additions.
