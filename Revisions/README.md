# Revisions
[Return to the main Table of Contents](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Formatting#table-of-contents)

The existing github does not have this. We could:
- Link to the other githubâ€™s online Forum
- Write suggestions based on our ongoing revision notes for design improvements.

## Wiring
Power wires: We should switch from XT30 to XT60 (the 18 AWG wires are too thick realistically to solder a good connection in the XT30's. Plus, we are going to be pulling about 30A for the jumps and that is the max continuous allowed Amps through that connector).
**ASKED ABOUT ON FORUM**

## Communications
We should look into switching between an ethernet tethered connection and a receiver/transmitter (ie. if we wanted to go fully untethered with the battery power supply option)
