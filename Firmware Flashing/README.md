# Firmware Flashing
[Return to the main Table of Contents](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Formatting#table-of-contents)

The github page outlines the firmware for flashing the master board, but not for flashing the micro drivers (mentioned briefly in the soldering section). We would make better documentation:
- Master Board and Micro Driver tabs with clear steps and images on the installation
- These tabs will outline the hardware and software procedures to have everything easily accessible in one place
