# Firmware Flashing

The github page outlines the firmware for flashing the master board, but not for flashing the micro drivers (mentioned briefly in the soldering section). We would make better documentation:
- Master Board and Micro Driver tabs with clear steps and images on the installation
- These tabs will outline the hardware and software procedures to have everything easily accessible in one place
