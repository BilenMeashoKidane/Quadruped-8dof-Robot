# Bill of Materials

Motivation for making our own BOM: 
- Difficulty to follow the existing github’s BOMs
- Wiring does not have quantities listed for the 8dof robot
- Very non intuitive organization for tools, hardware components, etc

We will break up the github’s Bill of Materials into separate categories based on the Bill of Materials that we made and modify as needed
