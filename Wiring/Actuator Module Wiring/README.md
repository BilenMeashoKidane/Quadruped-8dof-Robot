[Return to the wiring Table of Contents](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Quadruped-8dof-Robot/tree/main/Wiring#table-of-contents)

We provide instructions for all soldered components on the motors, and the assembly of the connection from a motor to a MicroDriver. Note that the encoder wiring is addressed in the MicroDriver wiring section. This section assumes that the motors have already been modified. You will need all of the following tools and materials to properly complete the instructions below:

| Item | Quantity | 
| --- | --- |
| Soldering Iron | 1 |
| Solder Spool | 1 |
| Solder Holder | 1 |
| Soldering Vise | 1 |
| Cleaning Sponge | 1 |
| Filter Fan | 1 |

## Motor Phase Wires
This step focuses on soldering all necessary pin headers to the MicroDriver.

| Item | Quantity | 
| --- | --- |
| Right Angle Pin Headers | 32 |
| Right Angle 5Pos Pin Header | 12 |


First, we will solder the power terminal connections. Repeat the following steps 4 times (1 time per MicroDriver).
