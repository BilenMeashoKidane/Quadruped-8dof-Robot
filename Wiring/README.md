# Wiring
[Return to the main Table of Contents](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Formatting#table-of-contents)

The existing wiring is a maze to navigate and make sense of on the existing github page, especially because they do not list quantities on the wiring BOM and interchange the TI and Micro Driver methods. We compiled Google Docs to roughly translate the wiring. We would make tabs for the following:
- Complete Wiring Schematics (basic depictions of the general overview), and each connection listed in the Detailed Wiring Components List documentation with our own images for more specific connection information.
- We still need to figure out the power safety board wiring on the robot (not listed on the existing github page)


## Table of Contents 
1. Wiring Schematics
2. MicroDriver Board Wiring
3. Master Board Wiring
4. Actuator Module Wiring
5. Power Supply Wiring
6. JTAG Emulator Wiring

This is a lot of material, so instead of inserting everything below, we can link these to different files for each wiring setup (this README would be very busy).
