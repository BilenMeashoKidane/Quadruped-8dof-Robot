## Table of Contents 
1. [Wiring Schematics](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Quadruped-8dof-Robot/blob/main/Wiring/Wiring%20Schematics/README.md#wiring-schematics)
2. Master Board Wiring
3. MicroDriver Board Wiring
4. Actuator Module Wiring
5. Power Supply Wiring
6. JTAG Emulator Wiring

This is a lot of material, so instead of inserting everything below, we can link these to different files for each wiring setup (this README would be very busy). We can include a description here about the general setup (ie. talk about choosing the MicroDriver method exclusively, not including feet sensors nor vicon markers, the 2 power supply methods - ie. give the overview). Overview can also include the masterlist of main electronic components in this step (ie. electronic boards)
