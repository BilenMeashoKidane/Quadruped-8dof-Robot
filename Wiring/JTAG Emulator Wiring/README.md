# JTAG Emulator Wiring
[Return to the wiring Table of Contents](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Quadruped-8dof-Robot/tree/main/Wiring#table-of-contents)

The JTAG emulator flashes the MicroDriver boards with a USB connection to your computer. Note that the JTAG emulator on our Bill of Materials includes this USB connection (USB to MicroUSB). This tab describes the wiring assembly for the JTAG emulator. The actual flashing process is described in the Firmware Flashing tab from the main table of contents. 

You will need all of the following tools and materials to properly complete the instructions below:

| Item | Quantity | 
| --- | --- |
| Soldering Iron | 1 |
| Solder Spool | 1 |
| Solder Holder | 1 |
| Soldering Vise | 1 |
| Cleaning Sponge | 1 |
| Filter Fan | 1 |
| Heat Gun | 1 |
| Wire Cutter | 1 |
| Wire Stripper | 1 |

Note: Same problem/confusion with the ribbon cable as the IMU connection -- the JTAG comes with a flashing adapter but it does not have the proper pins to connect to the MicroDrivers -- need to experiment with connections. Try to find an easier workaround than using the ribbon cable/making our own wire (tedious).
