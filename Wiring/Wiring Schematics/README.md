This section primarily aims to give a conceptual overview of the robot's wiring. For specific soldering instructions, visit each component's tab from the main wiring Table of Contents.

### System Overview Schematic
The four MicroDriver Boards are arranged in stacks of two boards. The following schematic depicts the wiring per MicroDriver board:

Each MicroDriver board plugs into the Master Board, has two pairs of motors and encoders, and attaches to the chosen power supply option.

### Power Supply Schematic
The main idea with the power supply option to power the robot is splitting two power supplies across four MicroDrivers and the Master Board.
