The robot can be powered by one of two methods: 
- External power supply
- Batteries on the robot

Below, we describe the implementation of both methods. In either case, each of the four MicroDrivers receives a supplying power cable. 

## MicroDriver Power Supply Cables
This step focuses on soldering power supply cables to the MicroDriver that will serve as the consumer connection, regardless of chosen power supply method. The following table lists the necessary tools, parts, and materials to complete this step.
