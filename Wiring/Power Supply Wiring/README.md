# Power Supply Wiring
[Return to the wiring Table of Contents](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Quadruped-8dof-Robot/tree/main/Wiring#table-of-contents)

The robot can be powered by one of two methods: 
- External power supply
- Batteries on the robot

Below, we describe the implementation of both methods. In either case, each of the four MicroDrivers receives a supplying power cable. 

## MicroDriver Power Supply Cables
This step focuses on soldering power supply cables to the MicroDriver that will serve as the consumer connection, regardless of chosen power supply method. The following table lists the necessary tools, parts, and materials to complete this step. 
| Item | Quantity | 
| --- | --- |
| Soldering Iron | 1 |
| Solder Spool | 1 |
| Solder Holder | 1 |
| Cleaning Sponge | 1 |
| Filter Fan | 1 |
| Wire Cutter | 1 |
| Wire Stripper | 1 |
| 20 AWG Black Wire | 80 cm |
| 20 AWG Red Wire | 80 cm |
| Female XT30 Connectors | 4 |
| Heat Shrink from XT30 Pack | 4 Red, 4 Black |
| --- | --- |

Repeat the following steps 4 times (1 time per MicroDriver)
| Step Description | Visual |

| Cut a red and a black 20 AWG (0.5mm^2) wire to 20cm. Strip off about 0.5 cm to 1 cm of the wire casing on one side of each wire and twist the exposed wire. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84528674/119542755-e2d2b500-bd5d-11eb-8f42-fa994dd837c3.png) |
