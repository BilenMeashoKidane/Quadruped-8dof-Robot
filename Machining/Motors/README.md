The motors need to modified before you can proceed with the wiring. The following table outlines the tools and materials you will need to complete this step.

| Item | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Small Pliers | 1 |
| 1.5mm Hex Driver | 1 |
| Vise | 1 |
| Hammer | 1 |
| Pin Driver | 1 |
| Motor Shaft Extraction Tool (3D Printed Part) | 1 |
| 3.98mm Reamer | 1 |
| 3.99mm Reamer | 1 |
| 4.00mm Reamer | 1 |
| Hand Tool | 1 |
| Cutting Oil | 1 Bottle |
| Wire Cutters | 1 |

Here is the procedure to machine the brushless motor rotors. Repeat eight times (once per motor).

| Step Description | Visual | 
| --- | --- |
| Remove and discard the retaining ring with small pliers. | --- |
| Place the brass washer and rotor on a clean surface free of metal particles. | --- |
| Unscrew and store the two M3 set screws on the rotor with a 1.5mm hex driver. | --- |
| Place the motor shaft extraction tool (a 3D printed part) in a vise, and use it to remove the motor shaft with a hammer and a pin driver. | --- |
| Secure the 3.98mm reamer in the hand tool. Rub cutting oil on the reamer. Carefully turn the reamer in the hole a few times. | --- |
| Rub oil on the custom motor shaft and try to insert it into the reamed hole. If the connection does not fit, use a 3.99mm and check again, then a 4.00mm reamer and check again until the shaft can be inserted and removed with force. It is important to use the smallest possible reamer because the shaft can wobble if the hole is too large. | --- |
| Screw the two M3 set screws back into the rotor with a 1.5mm hex driver. | --- |


Here is the procedure to machine the brushless motor stators. Repeat eight times (once per motor).
| Step Description | Visual | 
| --- | --- |
| Use wire cutters to remove the large heat shrink. | --- |
| Use wire cutters at an angle to strip a centimeter or so from the phase wire casing.  | --- |
| Grab the wire with the small pliers while stripping away the wire casing with your fingers. | --- |
| Pull off the wire casing with your fingers. | --- |
| Trim the exposed wires down to 3cm for all stators **except for the Hip AA motors** | --- |
| Use a soldering iron at about 400 degrees Celsius with a little solder on the tip of the iron to melt about 5mm of insulation on each wire. | --- |
| Trim about 2.5cm of 1.5mm heat shrink and use a heat gun on each individual phase wire (leaving the exposed wire without insulation). | --- |
