The encoders need to modified before you can proceed with the wiring. The following table outlines the tools and materials you will need to complete this step.

| Item | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| 3mm Drill Bit | 1 |
| Hand Drill | --- |
| 45 Degree Chamfer Tool | 1 |
| Wire Cutter | --- |
| Flat Pliers | --- |

Here is the procedure to machine the encoders. Repeat eight times (once per encoder).

| Step Description | Visual | 
| --- | --- |
| Increase the diameter of the 2.8mm mounting holes with a 3mm drill bit. | --- |
| Chamfer the mounting holes with a 45 degree chamfer tool. Test that the M3 flat head screws are flush against the encoder after chamfering. | --- |
