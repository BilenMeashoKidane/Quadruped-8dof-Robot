# E-Stop Switch Machining

[Return to the machining table of contents.](https://github.com/EmiliaPsacharopoulos/Quadruped-8dof-Robot/tree/main/Machining#table-of-contents)

The E-Stop Switch needs to modified before you can insert its cable glands. The following table outlines the tools and materials you will need to complete this step.

| Item | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Hand Dremel | 1 |
| Dremel Sander Bit | 1 |
| Hand Drill | 1 |
| Large Drill Bit (<= M20) | 1 |
| Drill Vise | 1 |
| Long Flat Head Screwdriver | 1 |
| E-Stop Switch | 1 |
| M20 Cable Glands | 2 |

Here is the procedure to attach the cable glands to the Lovato Electric E-Stop Switch. Repeat two times (once per M20 sized hole on the switch).

| Step Description | Visual | 
| --- | --- |
| Detach the push button's yellow top from its black bottom. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84528674/119875950-58bd5480-bef5-11eb-9524-32227026a465.png) |
| Use a long flat head screwdriver to detatch the switch from the black box. Then clamp the black box in the drill vise with an M20 sized hole facing upwards. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84528674/119876113-87d3c600-bef5-11eb-9f75-74133c8d558d.png) |
| Use the largest drill bit you can find (ideally M20) to carve out a large hole in the plastic. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84528674/119876296-bd78af00-bef5-11eb-9e0f-318783961d00.png) |
| Use the dremel and a sander bit to carve out material until you can fit the cable gland securely. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84528674/119876433-e436e580-bef5-11eb-8f8d-939184960c1c.png) |
| The connection should not be loose. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84528674/119876725-2e1fcb80-bef6-11eb-9e63-ede8767a09ff.png) |
| The finished connection will look like this: | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84528674/119877501-1e54b700-bef7-11eb-84ba-083178e25257.png) |
