### Step 1: Prepare 3D Printed Parts
Remove support materials using the needle nose pliers and files. Use caution when removing supports so that you do not damage the part. 

**Pro tip**: If the supports are proving really difficult to remove, leave prints in hot water for a few minutes and try again.

Note that some supports in the mass saving cutouts could not be removed. This is non-critical, and the solution is to include a raft layer or inverting the print orientation. After removing from the bed, the side piece may have a slight bend. This will be fixed with the bottom body structure attachment.
